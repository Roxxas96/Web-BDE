# Web-BDE v2

This web site is designed for student councils (BDE in french) to help them organize events and manage their association easily. It is still in development, any body can participate and leave a pull request.

This is the second version of the application, I decided to rewrite everything with microservice to make it more scalable and easier to maintain.

## Must have features

- Event system (creation, subscription)
- Integration system (challenge completion, leader board)
- Goodies shop
- Presentation page
- Clubs page
